## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy of the project.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sceptre-phenix.git
   ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote**: Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork up to date:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix.git
    ```

4. **(Optional) Update Your Fork with Upstream**: To keep your fork up to date with the original repository, follow these steps:
    * Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository
        ```bash
        git fetch upstream
        ```
    * Merge the changes from the upstream main branch into your local main branch
        ```bash
        git checkout main
        git merge upstream/main
        ```
    * Push the updated main branch to your forked repository
        ```bash
        git push origin main
        ```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in the [Issues](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix/issues) section. Be sure to include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant screenshots or logs.

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome suggestions for improvements! Please open an issue to discuss your ideas before implementing them. 

### Submitting Code

1. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch (on your fork of the repository) for your feature or bug fix using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) notation. The branch name should follow this format:
    ```bash
    type/description
    ```
    Where `type` can be one of the following:
    - `feat`: A new feature
    - `fix`: A bug fix
    - `docs`: Documentation only changes
    - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
    - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries

    Example:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/add-user-authentication
    ```

2. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes.

3. **Stage Your Changes**: Use the `git add` command to stage the changes you want to commit. You can stage specific files or all changes:
    To stage specific files:
    ```bash
    git add path/to/your/file1 path/to/your/file2
    ```

    To stage all changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) notation. Your commit message should follow this format:
    ```bash
    type(scope): subject
    ```
    * **Scope** is optional and can be used to indicate the area of the codebase affected by the change.
    * **Subject** should be a short description of the change.

    Example:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat(auth): add user authentication feature"
    ```
    If you need to write a longer commit message, you can do so by running `git commit`. This will open your default text editor where you can write a detailed commit message. The first line should be a brief summary conforming to the format above, followed by a blank line, and then a more detailed explanation. 

    Example:
    ```bash
    feat(auth): add user authentication feature

    This commit introduces a new authentication system that allows users to log in using their email and password. It also includes validation for user input and error handling.
    ```


4. **Rebase Your Branch**: Before opening a pull request, ensure your branch is up to date with the main branch.
    * Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository.
        ```bash
        git fetch upstream
        ```
    * Rebase your branch into the main branch to preserve a linear history. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the rebase process.
        ```bash
        git rebase upstream/main
        ```
    * (Optional) If you have multiple commits that you want to combine into a single commit, you can use interactive rebase.
        ```bash
        git rebase -i upstream/main
        ```
    In the interactive rebase interface, change the word `pick` to `squash` (or `s`) for all commits you want to combine into the first commit. After saving and closing the editor, you will be prompted to create a new commit message. Write a single, comprehensive commit message that summarizes all the changes.

5. **Push to Your Fork**: If you had to rebase, you may need to force push your changes to your forked repository.
    
    Example:
    ```bash
    git push origin feat/add-user-authentication --force
    ```
    
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository and open a [pull request](https://github.com/sandialabs/sceptre-phenix/pulls). Provide a clear description of your changes and reference any related issues.
